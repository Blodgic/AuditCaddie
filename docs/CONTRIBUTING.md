  - The framework/regulation it supports
  - Any special instructions for customization

### 2. Enhance Analyzers

- **Improve existing analysis tools** (such as SOC2 or DORA analyzers), or develop new tools for other frameworks or industries.
- Write clear documentation and example usage so others can benefit from your work.
- Submit improvements as pull requests with clear explanations of what you’ve added or changed.

### 3. Report Issues
