This README provides a structured approach to fine-tuning BERT for regulatory policy classification and compliance gap analysis. If you have any questions, open an issue or reach out!

# BERT GRC Policy Analyzer

## Align Your Policies with Confidence  
**Automatically map your internal policies to regulations—without the manual grind.**

---

## What Is It?

The **BERT GRC Policy Analyzer** is a machine learning tool that evaluates your internal policy documents and checks how well they align with major regulatory frameworks like:

- **NIST CSF**
- **SOC 2**
- **State Laws** (NY SHIELD, California Privacy Rights Act, etc.)

Instead of manually reading policies and comparing them to hundreds of pages of legal text, this analyzer uses a fine-tuned AI model to do it **automatically, quickly, and accurately**.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

Today’s compliance teams are overwhelmed. Regulations evolve fast, and every new state law or industry framework demands attention. The BERT GRC Policy Analyzer helps organizations:

- ✅ **Identify compliance gaps** in existing policies  
- ✅ **Save time** with automated policy-to-regulation comparisons  
- ✅ **Generate audit-ready reports** with confidence scores  
- ✅ **Improve internal governance** by showing how aligned you are  
- ✅ **Scale** across departments, frameworks, and geographies  

---

## How It Works (At a High Level)

1. **Input**: Your internal policies and applicable regulations (state, federal, or cybersecurity).
2. **Processing**: The analyzer reads and interprets your policies using a powerful language model trained on regulatory data.
3. **Output**:
   - A ranked list of how your policies align with specific regulations
   - Visual confidence scores (Top 1, Top 2, Top 3 likely matches)
   - A compliance gap report showing areas for improvement

---

## Integration with Your Workflow

- Run it as a script locally or in the cloud.
- Export results into spreadsheets or compliance dashboards.
- Works well with Jupyter, Colab, or SOC team notebooks.

---

## What Makes This Unique?

Unlike keyword scanners or basic rule-based tools, this uses a **fine-tuned version of BERT**, one of the most accurate AI models in language understanding. It understands nuance, context, and regulatory language far better than traditional tools.

> Think of it like a regulatory co-pilot—trained on the law, optimized for your security team.

---

## Use Cases

- Mapping HR or IT policies to NY SHIELD or ISO 27001
- Preparing for a **SOC 2 Type 2 audit**
- Generating evidence for **internal risk assessments**
- Supporting **M&A due diligence** and vendor reviews
- Running comparative **gap analyses** across jurisdictions

---

## What's Included

- Fine-tuned AI model trained on policy-regulation pairs
- Synthetic training data generator (if you want to expand coverage)
- Tools to evaluate model performance
- Output reports with regulatory match scores

---

## 📬 Want a Demo or Custom Use Case?

The analyzer can be tailored to any framework or jurisdiction—state, country, or sector-specific.

## 🧩 Future Vision

- Add explainability: *Why* did a policy match a regulation?
- Expand support for **financial**, **healthcare**, and **AI risk** laws
- Integrate into **Slack** or **GRC platforms** as a plug-and-play tool
